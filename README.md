InvisibleHand
=============

UIAutomation Testing Framework.

Take those yucky, Xcode generated UIAutomation scripts and turn them into a
structured, readable test suite. Invisible Hand provides a loose framework to
abstract UIelements into 'screens' which can be exercised with assertions and
interactions. The result is more readable tests and faster creation of test
cases.

### Getting started

#### Xcode generated automations

#### Create a screen

#### Create a test suite
